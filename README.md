#Project Writing Assignment 1

<h1>Who is K-CI Dineo Gonsalves?</h1>
<p>
It all started in 2003, the year that I was bound to be born. A couple of months before August the twenty-second, my mother found herself sitting in company with her two colleagues. Something that struct my mother’s attention was the name ‘Dineo’. Dineo is of Lesotho origin and means "Gift from God or Gifts" and that’s how I got my name.
</p>
<p> I carry my name with pride and ensure that it wont just be a word to others but rather a badge that I carry. Therefore, I’m extremely hard on myself. The way I see it, it could be a strength or a weakness but I choose to see it as a strength. My name pushes me to do greater, to be greater. 
</p>
<p> 
What is this greater that I speak of? My name means gifts of God, so where ever I lay my head or take a step I aim to be an example of the Kingdom of God. I’ve been serving at Every Nation Rosebank for over 5 years in Kids Ministry and 1 year in the Production Team as a ProPresenter. YES!! I enjoy every second of it, whether its to lead a project, to be surrounded by people or just to lend a helping hand.
</p>
<p>
‘Gifts’ in my name means plural. So not only am I a people’s person but I’m creative, colourful and free. In my free time or when I can I LOVE to paint and get my hands, feet and all my new clothing dirty. I do it for fun and a way of income. I always find ways to earn an honest buck. In High School all the staff knew me the Cupcake Girl because I would walk around in a tutu selling cupcakes not because I was a baker but rather an entrepreneur.  
</p>
<p>To conclude my 10 000-word essay *wink, I’m a people’s person, I love having fun and messing around with colour. I’m flexible to change and constantly find ways to improve myself for the ever-changing world, not only to carry my name as a badge but to stay relevant for society.
